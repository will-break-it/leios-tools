# Linear Leios vote diffusion study

The question is whether simple vote streaming remains feasible with a large
committee, and whether selective fetching or reduced fanout improves timing,
bandwidth or verification cost. The comparison covers Linear Leios. Full Haskell
node parity is not a prerequisite for this experiment.

## Transport terminology

The [transport definitions in the report](vote-diffusion-results-20260910/README.md#transport-terminology)
map figure labels to the exact configuration values. `push` marks a vote's ID
seen on arrival and suppresses copies even while verification is pending.
`push-late-dedupe` marks it seen after verification, so copies received while the
first check is pending can trigger additional checks. Both discard copies of
already verified votes. This is the meaning of “early” and “late” deduplication
in earlier descriptions; neither term describes when the vote is sent.

The [Haskell source context and sim-rs comparison](vote-diffusion-results-20260910/README.md#why-compare-the-two-duplicate-handling-orders)
explain why both settings are tested: the inspected prototype records a vote as
known only after verification, so concurrent copies can repeat that work without
counting the vote twice. The alternative suppresses pending copies to measure
how much verification work they cause. Neither arm is a Haskell runtime benchmark.

## Committee reference

[CIP PR #1196](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/1196) replaced
weighted Fait Accompli with a stake-based committee. The subsequent
[open PR #1250](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/1250), checked at
[`e173ea52`](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/CIPs/blob/e173ea5250e99e93db3436205f32f755169f1866/CIP-0164/README.md#committee-structure),
proposes a fixed committee size. These are distinct selection rules:

| Simulator mode | Eligible voters | Vote weight | Quorum denominator |
|---|---|---|---|
| `everyone` | Every topology node, including relays | 1 | Number of nodes |
| `top-stake-seats` | Top N stake-holding pools | Pool's active stake | Total active stake |
| `top-stake-fraction` | Pools covering the configured stake fraction | Pool's active stake | Total active stake |

The fixed-size reference uses `committee-seat-count: 900` and
`quorum-weight-fraction: 0.75`. Fewer than 900 pools means all available pools
are seated. Unseated stake remains in the denominator: a committee holding less
than 75% of total active stake cannot certify, even if all its members vote.
The simulator warns when seated stake cannot reach the quorum; such configurations
remain available for deliberate failure experiments. Node identifiers (topology
name order) break equal-stake ties.

The 750/1500-node everyone-votes scenarios are deliberate vote-volume stress
tests, also discussed in the CIP proposal. They do not implement stake quorum.
The supplied topologies have fewer than 900 stake-holding pools, so the
fixed-size reference alone does not exercise 900 distinct voters. Keep both
committee modes and report the actual eligible pool count and stake coverage.
A 1500-node everyone-votes run requires 1125 votes for its count-based quorum;
that threshold is separate from how many votes actually get cast.

## Workload and timing

`study-linear-tx-load.yaml` uses a **6 ms interarrival interval**, approximately
167 transactions per second in total, with 1500-byte transactions from 60 to
960 seconds. It overrides the upstream study's 10 ms interval. This preserves
the previous experiment's load; the earlier description of 6 tx/s was wrong.
It represents configured offered load, not achieved throughput.

With the study configuration, voting opens at `t0 + 3 * L_hdr = t0 + 3s` and
closes at `t0 + 3 * L_hdr + L_vote = t0 + 7s`. Both the EB producer and other
voters obey this window. Receiving an EB before the deadline does not suffice:
validation and vote signing must finish by the deadline too. Late completion
is reported under `LateEB`. Vote diffusion and certificate inclusion have their
separate `L_diff` allowance; the summary prints the inclusion boundary as well.
A quorum-by-7s metric measures earlier attainment, not the entire inclusion
allowance.

## Corrections and status of earlier findings

Results previously reported on PR #1 came from revision `6e24ebe8`. The
[corrected 108-run study](vote-diffusion-results-20260910/README.md) now provides
measurements of the fixed simulator; earlier figures below are historical.

- `top-stake-seats` previously gave each pool weight 1 and used filled seats
  as its quorum denominator. It now uses pool stake and total active stake.
- Accepted arrivals are counted from completed first acceptance, excluding
  locally generated votes, redundant copies and votes for pruned EBs. Pending
  arrivals are reported separately. `received - duplicates` previously counted
  unfinished verifications as accepted and understated verification cost per
  acceptance. The obsolete-vote classification preserves existing relay behavior.
- Vote announcement/request receives are emitted on delivery. Aggregate output
  no longer credits the recipient when the sender merely queues a message.
- The matrix runner sets fanout and transport independently in each generated
  overlay, so a fanout sweep cannot override `push-late-dedupe` with `push`.
- Producers now wait for the voting gate. Both validation and signing completion
  are checked against the deadline. These behavior changes require rerunning
  comparisons before quoting the old timings as measurements of current code.
- The bounded-fanout cap sampled a relay's block producer like any other
  consumer. Every stake pool in both study topologies is a producer with
  exactly two relays, so at fanout k each relay skipped it with probability
  about 1 − k/d for its d consumers. From the topology alone, the stake at
  producers expected to fall below the quorum line exceeds 5% at every tested
  cap, while relays have 25 to 50 inbound links each. That is a plausible
  mechanism for the Q95 losses, not a measured cause: the summary logs carry no
  per-node data, and the bundle-delivery statistic counts nodes, not stake. The
  new `vote-push-fanout-protects-producers: true` rule prioritizes explicitly
  marked BP connections within the same total cap. The default remains `false`,
  preserving the rule of the 2026-09-10 fanout rows. Those rows need a rerun
  with both settings before drawing a conclusion about protecting BP links.

The earlier everyone-votes comparison reported 1500-node quorum timings of
about 3.525s for push versus 4.002s for announce/request at Q95 (quorum available
at nodes collectively holding 95% of network stake),
and a traffic ratio of about 7.9, using flat 8-byte announcements and requests
against 94-byte vote bodies. Those remain historical observations for their
configured arms; changing control sizes can change congestion and timing too. Equal certified-block counts do not prove identical certified
EB identities; that claim requires comparing identifiers in traces.

The old fanout conclusion is **superseded by the corrected matrix**. Fanout 22
can retain Q50 (quorum at nodes holding 50% of stake) while losing Q95 entirely.
In the 1500-node everyone-votes arm that marks seen after verification, it
reduced verification work and increased L1 endorsements from 13 to 18 across
three seeds, but Q95 attainment fell from 37/72 EBs to zero. The stake-weighted reference likewise
lost Q95 with every tested bounded fanout. See the corrected report for the full
matrix, missed-quorum counts and the distinction between nodes having enough
votes for a quorum and individual vote bodies being delivered. These results do
not establish a safe fanout limit. They do not establish an unsafe one either:
the cap they measured could skip block producers, as described above.

## Measuring obsolete vote work

The new obsolete-work metrics preserve the existing transport behavior. An
obsolete bundle is one whose referenced EBs are all in the measuring node's
`pruned_ebs` set. This is local state, not simply a vote arriving after its
signing deadline. Nodes still verify, cache and forward the same messages.

The summary reports the following **subsets of the existing totals**:

- Arrivals obsolete when received, their bytes, and how many had already been
  generated or successfully processed at that receiving node.
- Verifications obsolete when completed. A validation can span a prune, so
  this count need not match arrivals already obsolete on receipt.
- First and repeat completed processing at a node. A repeat verification with
  no held copy before insertion is additionally counted as a **cache reinsertion**.
  Concurrent duplicate completions with a held copy are repeats without a
  cache reinsertion. Locally generated votes count as prior processing too.
- Bodies and announcements sent while obsolete at the sender, including bodies
  served in response to requests. Their bytes remain in the normal traffic total.

The monitor remembers prior processing in a bitset; simulated nodes never read
it. No CPU work or traffic is subtracted. The `VTBundleObsolete*` events also
appear in raw traces. Older logs have no obsolete-work breakdown: the extractor
leaves the field absent rather than inventing zeros.

This distinguishes first late processing from repeated work after the cache
has forgotten a vote. The pinned Haskell `LeiosVoteState` retains its seen-vote
set and has no garbage collection yet; it can still verify a previously unseen
late vote. Consequently, dropping every pruned-EB vote would be a separate
modeling change, not an accounting fix. Completed verification totals count
work the simulator actually performed, including work on obsolete votes. The
open modeling question is whether forgetting vote IDs during pruning matches
the intended node behavior. The new measurements do not establish
how much pruning affected the published 108 runs; those archived logs lack this
breakdown. A full matrix rerun is deferred until review or targeted evidence
justifies it, especially before making a behavior change or new effect-size claim.

## Validation of the published study

- `cargo test --workspace --locked --offline`: 155 passed, one ignored (after removing the unused no-deduplication mode and its test).
- Twenty 8-node, 40-slot smoke runs: two seeds, both committee modes,
  announce/request, and both push dedupe orders with unlimited and bounded
  fanout. These check execution and accounting, not mainnet-scale feasibility.
- An overloaded trace reconciled exactly with its summary: 56 distinct relevant
  acceptances, 14 pending arrivals and 98 completed verifications.
- An uneven-stake trace counted eight generated vote bodies separately from
  2400 total voting weight. All 16 reported node quorums met 750 stake out
  of 1000 total active stake.
- A dry-run check covered 40 planned matrix entries, checking that fanout and
  validation order were crossed under matching seeds, sizes and committees.

The [750/1500-node performance study](vote-diffusion-results-20260910/README.md)
is now complete. The checks above established correctness before those reruns.

## Validation of the review changes

- `cargo test --workspace --locked --offline`: 158 passed, one ignored.
- `python3 scripts/test-vote-diffusion-study.py`: nine checks cover the runner's
  108-row plan, smaller matrices, manifests, parse failures, obsolete-work
  reconciliation, and exact re-extraction of the published results.
- A real 750-node, one-slot smoke matrix completed and parsed all three transport
  arms. This checks the runner/extractor interface, not voting feasibility.
- Ten paired 8-node, 80-slot runs against PR head `00d6983` match every existing
  protocol and network summary line. They cover both committee modes, all three
  transports and bounded push fanout, with 500 ms vote verification to exercise
  queued duplicate checks.
- Node regression tests exercise arrivals after pruning, validations spanning a
  prune, obsolete forwarding and later requests, and held-copy deduplication in
  all three transports. Monitor tests separate first processing, duplicate
  completions and cache reinsertions, including a node's own generated votes.

The 108-run matrix has not been repeated for this instrumentation-only change.
The additional fields in new logs measure existing work rather than replacing
or revising the archived results. Quantifying that breakdown at mainnet scale
remains a separate experiment.

## Running the matrix

From `sim-rs`, pass the upstream study configuration (the earlier runs used
`ouroboros-leios` revision `f307ed5`):

```sh
./scripts/vote-diffusion-study.sh \
  <ouroboros-leios>/analysis/sims/2026w18/experiments/config.yaml \
  /tmp/vote-study-corrected 0 1 2
```

The output directory must be new and its parent must exist. Each run saves a
summary, a final parameter overlay, and a row in `runs.csv`. The directory also
contains copies of the base configuration, workload, engine configuration and
topologies, plus the source revision, tracked diff and built binary SHA-256. No trace files are
produced. A private copy of the built executable is retained as `sim-cli`.
The runner writes all planned rows before execution, then records start/end UTC,
elapsed seconds, exit code and status after each run. Input and log checksum
manifests accompany the output; the frozen executable and inputs are checked
before each run and the full set is checked after the batch. Run status `passed`
means the simulator exited successfully, not that all EBs achieved quorum. A
failed simulation makes the script exit nonzero.

Set `VOTE_STUDY_CONFIG_REVISION` to the source revision of an exported base
configuration. Otherwise the runner records its enclosing Git revision if
available, or explicitly records that it is unknown. The input bytes are saved
in either case. `revision.txt` and `source.patch` identify the simulator source;
`defaults.yaml` saves the shared defaults for provenance. It is not passed as
an overlay: sim-cli applies its own TCP default after loading those defaults,
and the runner preserves that behavior.

To extract a fresh run directory, including a smaller matrix:

```sh
python3 docs/vote-diffusion-results-20260910/extract-results.py /tmp/vote-study-corrected
```

This checks that directory's own manifests and reads only its topology sizes.
Missing metrics or incomplete/failed runs produce a nonzero exit status and are
listed in `results.json`; they are never counted as parsed results. Use
`--archive` only when re-extracting the frozen September 10 archives against
the manifests shipped beside the extractor. Run the interface regression checks
with `python3 scripts/test-vote-diffusion-study.py`. Python 3.11 or later is
required by the runner and extractor.

Defaults:

| Setting | Default |
|---|---|
| Seeds | `0` unless supplied as arguments |
| `VOTE_STUDY_SIZES` | `750 1500` |
| `VOTE_STUDY_COMMITTEES` | `everyone top-stake-seats` |
| `VOTE_STUDY_FANOUTS` | `all 22 16 8` |
| `VOTE_STUDY_TRANSPORTS` | `announce-then-request push push-late-dedupe` |
| `VOTE_STUDY_ANNOUNCEMENT_BYTES` | `8` |
| `VOTE_STUDY_REQUEST_BYTES` | `8` |
| `VOTE_STUDY_NODE_TRAFFIC` | `0` (set `1` to save per-node vote traffic) |
| `VOTE_STUDY_FANOUT_PROTECTS_PRODUCERS` | `false` |
| `VOTE_STUDY_SLOTS` | `400` |
| `VOTE_STUDY_DRY_RUN` | `0` |
| `VOTE_STUDY_CONFIG_REVISION` | Detected from base config, or explicitly unknown |

For each size, committee and seed, the runner normally executes announce/request once,
then both `push` and `push-late-dedupe` at every fanout. Echo-to-source is held
false for this matrix. `VOTE_STUDY_FANOUT_PROTECTS_PRODUCERS=false` preserves
sampling across all consumers, as in the 2026-09-10 fanout rows. With `true`,
protected BP connections take places within the same total cap: one protected
BP at fanout 22 leaves 21 places for other consumers. Source exclusion still
applies. A node with more protected consumers than the cap is rejected.

The runner marks each BP's two upstream entries with `always-forward-votes: true`
in both saved study topologies. Routing uses those explicit markers, not stake.
For other topologies, mark the consumer's own relay entries under `producers`.
Enabling protection with a bounded cap requires marked links and at least one
unprotected consumer. Without a cap, protection is accepted with a warning for
compatibility with the archived unrestricted-push overlay; unlimited push already
forwards to every consumer. Node/peer roles are prepared once per node.

Run once with each protection value into separate output directories. Run names
include protection and both control-message sizes, `runs.csv` records all three,
and the extractor distinguishes these settings. Unlimited push and announce/request use
`bpfalse` because no bounded selection applies. The default is **36 runs per seed**, or 108 for the
three-seed command above. Runs execute sequentially and can take many hours.
`VOTE_STUDY_TRANSPORTS` selects a subset, including a single transport.
Use a smaller matrix first, or preview it without building or running:

```sh
VOTE_STUDY_DRY_RUN=1 \
VOTE_STUDY_SIZES='1500' \
VOTE_STUDY_COMMITTEES='top-stake-seats' \
VOTE_STUDY_FANOUTS='all 22' \
./scripts/vote-diffusion-study.sh <study-config.yaml> /tmp/vote-study-plan 0 1 2
```

This plans 15 runs: five arms per seed. Rerun the command with a new output
directory and without `VOTE_STUDY_DRY_RUN=1` to execute them. The command preserves
the supplied config rather than silently fetching a moving upstream revision.

For an individual experiment, reuse the corresponding generated overlay from
that plan directory, or extract the exact overlay from the published input
archive. The runner produces the complete committee, seed, transport and fanout
settings together; separate transport presets are unnecessary.

Record quorum attainment and misses per EB, Q50/Q95 attainment, vote
bodies generated, actual eligible stake, total protocol bytes, completed
verifications, accepted arrivals and pending arrivals. Keep a fixed scenario
and seed across each comparison. The reported Q95 time is a mean of per-EB times
at which nodes holding 95% of stake each have a quorum; it is not a worst-case
deadline guarantee. Preserve miss counts alongside conditional timing averages.

## Limits on transfer to the Haskell node

The [pinned Haskell audit in the report](vote-diffusion-results-20260910/README.md#why-compare-the-two-duplicate-handling-orders)
links the exact node and consensus revisions and explains the checks before and
after verification that motivate `push-late-dedupe`. The simulator does not
reproduce the node's per-peer serial handling, shared notification queue or
credit-dependent vote drops. The audit was source inspection, not a node runtime benchmark.

The simulator's ranking-header identifier announcement/request/body exchange
also differs from the node's full-header Leios announcements. Haskell validates
those announcements before forwarding; its separate ChainSync path remains
relevant too. A simple one-latency network calculation omits queueing and
validation and cannot establish that no real header misses `L_hdr`.

A shared header approximation does not necessarily cancel between arms:
verification load changes CPU queueing, which changes header eligibility and
subsequent votes cast. This feedback can change the transport comparison as
well as absolute rates. Header and flow-control sensitivity are follow-up
checks for transferring quantitative backlog or certification claims to the
node. The present matrix answers voting-strategy feasibility within the stated
model; it does not predict the prototype's exact certification loss.

## Per-node vote traffic

The [captured 1500-node unrestricted-push case](vote-traffic-20260915/README.md)
provides BP/relay tables, all 1500 node rows, raw counters and reproduction inputs.

The archived 108 runs saved network totals, not individual-node traffic. The
report's [Wire GB range](vote-diffusion-results-20260910/README.md#fanout-and-validation-order)
is the sum sent across the network, with each send counted once. It is not a
per-node value or a sum of sends plus receives.

`sim-cli --vote-traffic report.json` saves an optional, vote-only report without
retaining or serializing a full event trace. It supports the two Linear Leios
variants. Each configured node has body, announcement and request counts/bytes
in both directions, plus fixed one-second byte buckets indexed from simulation
time zero. Duplicate and obsolete bodies remain included in those totals;
classification events do not add the same traffic twice. State scales with
node-seconds rather than the number of message copies. Body sizes are carried
on arrivals, so the recorder needs no bundle-size cache.
The destination must not already exist or alias the event output. A temporary
file is opened before the simulation starts and published only after successful
completion. Monitor failures cancel the simulation, and failed/interrupted
captures leave the destination available for retry. Ctrl-C on an ordinary run
without capture still saves events and exits successfully. The study runner
requires the full-duration completion marker before marking any run passed,
including runs without traffic capture.

Send timestamps mean **queued for transmission**; receive timestamps mean
**delivered**. A peak is the busiest fixed one-second bucket, not instantaneous
NIC throughput or a sliding-window maximum. Sending to multiple links can
produce a node-wide rate above one link's bandwidth. These are modeled vote
mini-protocol bytes only; they exclude TCP/IP framing and other protocols.
The report records the requested slot count and last observed event time.
The summarizer requires a final completion marker and an exactly matching
finite duration before computing mean rates. Stake distinguishes BPs from relays only in topologies that model
the BP as a separate node.

For one run with the original study inputs, use the study configuration extracted
from `vote-diffusion-results-20260910/inputs.tar.gz` as the first argument:

```sh
VOTE_STUDY_SIZES=1500 VOTE_STUDY_COMMITTEES=top-stake-seats \
VOTE_STUDY_TRANSPORTS=push VOTE_STUDY_FANOUTS=all \
VOTE_STUDY_NODE_TRAFFIC=1 VOTE_STUDY_SLOTS=400 \
VOTE_STUDY_CONFIG_REVISION=f307ed5fa7077a32eb470ca3832a34092882bfe3 \
  scripts/vote-diffusion-study.sh /tmp/study-config.yaml /tmp/vote-node-traffic 0

python3 scripts/summarize-vote-traffic.py \
  /tmp/vote-node-traffic/1500-top-stake-seats-push-fall-bpfalse-a8-r8-s0.vote-traffic.json \
  --duration 400 \
  --log /tmp/vote-node-traffic/1500-top-stake-seats-push-fall-bpfalse-a8-r8-s0.txt \
  --output /tmp/vote-node-traffic/breakdown
```

The runner hashes captured reports in `vote-traffic-sha256.json`. The summarizer
checks per-node time buckets against totals and reconciles send counts/bytes
and body arrivals against the final global log summary. Version 1 archives
also require the original successful `runs.csv` through `--legacy-runs`; their
logs predate the completion marker. It writes `nodes.csv` and `summary.md`,
with BP/relay totals and percentiles across nodes. Its input also accepts `.json.gz`.
A report from one unrestricted-push run explains traffic distribution for that
case; it does not test whether the protected-BP fanout rule restores quorum.

The runner checks the executable's embedded revision against `revision.txt`,
rebuilds the CLI if a cached version is stale, and stops if they still differ.
The build script tracks common Git refs in linked worktrees. Historical binary
metadata remains unchanged in archived results.

Capture regression checks exercise the actual CLI, including existing outputs,
path aliases, monitor failure, interruption and retry:

```sh
python3 scripts/test-vote-traffic-cli.py --binary target/release/sim-cli
python3 scripts/test-summarize-vote-traffic.py
```

## Focused fanout and control-size follow-up

`vote-announcement-size-bytes` and `vote-request-size-bytes` independently set
Linear Leios vote-bundle control-message sizes. Both default to 8. Sizes include
the identifier and application framing and exclude TCP/IP. They are carried by
the messages through the network scheduler and arrival accounting, so changing
them changes transmission time as well as the reported bytes. Other protocol
messages keep their existing sizes. Nondefault sizes on unsupported Leios
variants and zero sizes are rejected.

The generic runner exposes these as `VOTE_STUDY_ANNOUNCEMENT_BYTES` and
`VOTE_STUDY_REQUEST_BYTES`. Every run name, overlay, runs.csv row and extraction
key records both sizes; paired comparisons use a matching control-size baseline.
Old CSVs are interpreted with the historical 8/8 defaults.

The focused runner freezes ten cases per seed into one matrix and runs them with
one checked executable: push at fanout 22/16/8 with and without BP protection,
unlimited push, and announce/request at 8/8, 40/40 and 64/64 bytes. Sizes above 8
are sensitivity assumptions, not verified encodings. Its scope is 1500 nodes
and stake-weighted voting; it does not repeat the everyone-votes stress test.

```sh
# First extract study-config.yaml from the original input archive.
VOTE_STUDY_CONFIG_REVISION=f307ed5fa7077a32eb470ca3832a34092882bfe3 \
  python3 scripts/vote-diffusion-followup.py /tmp/study-config.yaml /tmp/vote-followup 0
python3 scripts/summarize-vote-diffusion-followup.py /tmp/vote-followup \
  --output /tmp/vote-followup/breakdown
```

The default duration is 400 slots; `VOTE_STUDY_SLOTS` changes it. A dry run uses
`VOTE_STUDY_DRY_RUN=1`. Per-node capture defaults on for this focused matrix and
can be disabled with `VOTE_STUDY_NODE_TRAFFIC=0`. All inputs, scripts, row names,
logs, capture files and the executable checksum are retained. One seed is a
pilot comparison; repeat promising cases across seeds before broad claims.

The focused summarizer verifies capture checksums, completed logs, topology
membership and control-message sizes, then reconciles every per-node report
against the final network totals. Its tables compare BP protection under a
fixed total cap and executed control-size variants against the same unrestricted
push baseline. Separate per-node CSVs retain the traffic distribution for every
case. It also compares unprotected 8/8 outcomes with matching archived runs.
