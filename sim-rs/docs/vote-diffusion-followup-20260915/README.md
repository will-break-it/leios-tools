# Focused vote diffusion follow-up

This pilot revisits two assumptions in the [108-run study](../vote-diffusion-results-20260910/README.md): whether bounded fanout should protect BP connections, and how pull changes when announcements and requests exceed the original 8-byte assumption. It adds per-node traffic for every case.

The matrix has ten completed 400-slot runs at 1500 nodes, using top-stake-seats and seed 0. Every push case uses `push`, which marks a vote seen on arrival. `push-late-dedupe`, which marks it seen only after verification and is the order the inspected Haskell prototype uses, is not in this matrix. The 458 BPs carry the voting stake; 1042 relays carry no stake. The topology and load match the original seed-0 reference cases. This is one seed and one committee, so it does not repeat the everyone-votes CPU stress test or establish a generally safe fanout.

## Findings

**Protecting BP connections changes the fanout result.** At all three caps, protection restores the unrestricted-push Q95 and endorsement counts in this pilot. The total cap is unchanged.

| Cap | Q95 unprotected → protected | Endorsements unprotected → protected | Unprotected GB | Protected GB | Protected Q95 mean s |
|---:|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 22 | 0/26 → 20/26 | 7 → 8 | 19.470 | 19.621 | 3.335 |
| 16 | 0/26 → 20/26 | 1 → 8 | 14.194 | 14.375 | 3.338 |
| 8 | 0/26 → 20/26 | 0 → 8 | 7.097 | 7.380 | 3.345 |

Unrestricted push sends **32.684 GB** with a **3.334s** Q95 mean. Protected cap 8 sends **7.380 GB**, a **77.4% reduction**, with a **3.345s** mean (0.011s later). All protected cases deliver every generated bundle to at least 95% of nodes. That does not mean every node received every vote. These findings apply to this seed, topology and to `push`. BP protection is untested with `push-late-dedupe`, which the 108-run study found changes endorsement counts under load.

**The bandwidth ratio depends strongly on control-message size.** The following rows are actual simulations. The push references send no control messages and are reused across the three pull sizes.

| Announce / request bytes | Pull vote GB | Unrestricted push / pull bytes | Protected cap 8 / pull bytes | Pull Q95 | Pull Q95 mean s | Endorsements |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|
| 8/8 | 4.149 | 7.88x | 1.78x | 20/26 | 3.850 | 8 |
| 40/40 | 15.715 | 2.08x | 0.47x | 20/26 | 3.850 | 8 |
| 64/64 | 24.390 | 1.34x | 0.30x | 20/26 | 3.850 | 8 |

**Pull avoids duplicate body transfers in the baseline.** Its **8,927 bundles × 1,499 other nodes = 13,381,573 bodies**, with zero redundant arrivals and one completed verification per accepted arrival. It sends **13,381,573 requests** and **348,055,165 announcements**. The body transfers therefore have the spanning-tree count in this request-from-first run; announcements still flood the mesh. This does not establish the same behavior for other request strategies or network conditions.

At 8/8 bytes, pull traffic comprises **1.258 GB of bodies, 2.784 GB of announcements and 0.107 GB of requests**. Request sizes are included. The 40/40 and 64/64 cases are sensitivity assumptions, not verified wire encodings.

**Absolute node traffic is concentrated at relays.** The selected comparison below shows the unrestricted reference and protected cap 8. The bundle contains all ten per-node reports.

| Transport | Role | Total sent GB | Median sent MB/node | Max sent MB/node | Median received MB/node | Max node peak sent Mbit/s |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Unrestricted push | BP | 0.385164 | 0.841 | 0.841 | 1.581 | 0.333 |
| Unrestricted push | relay | 32.298928 | 25.970 | 153.114 | 30.577 | 60.649 |
| Protected cap 8 | BP | 0.385164 | 0.841 | 0.841 | 1.240 | 0.333 |
| Protected cap 8 | relay | 6.994522 | 6.713 | 6.713 | 6.507 | 2.659 |

No obsolete verifications were measured in these ten runs. The original CPU-stress cases have not been rerun with that instrumentation, so this does not quantify their obsolete work.

All five repeated unprotected 8/8 configurations match their archived protocol results, including quorum counts and times, endorsements, vote generation, traffic and verification. The original 108-run data also still re-extracts unchanged.

## What changed

Protected fanout gives explicitly marked BP connections priority **within the same total cap**. A relay protecting one BP at cap 22 has 21 places left for other consumers. Protection defaults to false, preserving archived input behavior. These cases compare the choice of recipients under one budget; they do not give the protected arm an extra copy.

Announcement and request sizes are independently configurable. The tested pairs are 8/8, 40/40 and 64/64 bytes. Each includes a modeled identifier and application framing, excluding TCP/IP. The larger values are sensitivity assumptions, not measurements of a specific wire encoding. Changing them affects the network scheduler, so these are executed simulations rather than arithmetic repricing of unchanged message counts. Bodies remain 94 bytes in this committee.

The same unrestricted-push run is the reference for all three pull cases. Push sends no vote announcements or requests, so those settings do not change its traffic. Pull uses request-from-first. The reported aggregate totals count sends once; adding receives would count delivered bytes a second time.

The runs keep existing transport behavior for obsolete votes. Obsolete work remains included in the total and is also reported separately. This pilot cannot quantify obsolete work in the heavier everyone-votes case, or under `push-late-dedupe`, which verifies a copy before recording the vote as seen.

## Reading the tables

The [evidence bundle](evidence.tar.gz) contains `breakdown/SUMMARY.md` with quorum availability, exact wire bytes, control-size ratios, message counts, obsolete verification work and per-node distributions. `breakdown/followup.json` retains the full numeric record. Each run has a per-node CSV and summary inside the bundle. The key comparisons are shown above so this PR can be reviewed without opening generated data files.

Q95 means nodes holding 95% of stake each have the votes for a certificate. Each node's certificate threshold is 75% of total voting stake. Q50 is the corresponding availability measure at 50% of stake. Neither is the percentage of votes delivered. The separate bundle-coverage statistic counts receiving nodes without weighting by stake.

Q95 times are measured from the EB's slot boundary and averaged only over EBs that attain Q95. Equal counts do not prove equal EB identities. The fixed cutoff can leave the newest EBs unfinished; timing alone is not evidence of equal availability.

Per-node peaks use fixed one-second windows and sum outgoing links. Sends are counted when queued and receives when delivered. These are neither instantaneous nor sliding-window link-throughput measurements. Bandwidth limits are 10 Mbit/s per link, not per node. Decimal MB/GB are used throughout.

## Provenance and reproduction

All ten runs use simulator revision `825982b42e519184b5fd890298662ab29797f091`, with an empty source patch and an executable reporting `sim-cli 2.0.1-825982b`. The SHA-256 digest is in `binary.sha256` inside the evidence bundle. Upstream configuration is pinned to `f307ed5fa7077a32eb470ca3832a34092882bfe3`. The runner saved the exact base config, overlays, topology, workload, engine, runner scripts and all checksums.

The historical [single-run capture](../vote-traffic-20260915/README.md) remains unchanged and still discloses its earlier binary-version mismatch. This matrix has matching source and embedded binary revisions.

The analysis scripts are pinned to `e18ff497e95c699008b2fa463b3948afa93b399d` in `analysis-revision.txt`, with individual hashes in `analysis-sha256.json`. Use those scripts or the unchanged copies in this report's repository revision. To reconstruct the saved run directory and reproduce its tables, from `sim-rs`:

```sh
report=docs/vote-diffusion-followup-20260915
run_dir=$(mktemp -d)
tar -xzf "$report/evidence.tar.gz" -C "$run_dir"
python3 scripts/summarize-vote-diffusion-followup.py "$run_dir" \
  --output "$run_dir/reproduced"
```

The summarizer verifies frozen input/log/capture hashes, successful completion, requested duration, topology membership and control-message sizes. It reconciles each per-node capture with the final global summary before generating the tables. `SUMMARY.md`, `followup.json`, and every per-node CSV/summary reproduce byte for byte. The general extractor's `updated_utc` timestamp is not part of this deterministic comparison.

To rerun simulations, check out the simulator revision above in a separate worktree and use the saved base config:

```sh
git worktree add --detach /tmp/leios-vote-sim-825982b \
  825982b42e519184b5fd890298662ab29797f091
cd /tmp/leios-vote-sim-825982b/sim-rs
VOTE_STUDY_CONFIG_REVISION=f307ed5fa7077a32eb470ca3832a34092882bfe3 \
  VOTE_STUDY_SLOTS=400 \
  python3 scripts/vote-diffusion-followup.py "$run_dir/study-config.yaml" \
  /tmp/vote-followup-new 0
```

The focused runner enables per-node capture by default and freezes one executable for the whole matrix. Supply a new output directory. Additional seed numbers repeat the ten-case matrix; they are not part of the data published here.

Evidence archive SHA-256: `094896d65976c826c8fb4df089460b4d010e3d86338be63e1843ea725267e523`. The `artifact-sha256.json` inside verifies every other archived file. The executable itself is not included; its matching embedded version and checksum are retained.
